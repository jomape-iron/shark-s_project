# Welcome to my First Project: Shark Attacks

Welcome to my first project! In this project, I have been working with a Kaggle Dataset called "Shark Attacks," which contains data on reported shark attacks. The dataset includes information such as the location of the attacks, the activity being performed at the time, victim information (name, gender, age), shark species, and more.

## Project Overview

As a first approach, I have formulated several hypotheses to test by extracting, cleaning, and visualizing data from the dataset. The main hypotheses I will be investigating are:

    Hypothesis 1: Men are more likely to be involved in driving accidents compared to women, and the same may apply to put them life in risk with shark attacks.
    Hypothesis 2: Shark attacks increase year by year, the same as global population growth.
    Hypothesis 3: Weekends have a higher occurrence of shark attacks due to crowded beaches.
    Hypothesis 4: Countries with higher income per capita experience more boat-related shark attacks.

## Dataset

The "Shark Attacks" dataset from Kaggle is a comprehensive collection of reported shark attacks worldwide. It contains a range of variables that can be analyzed to gain insights into various factors contributing to shark attacks.

## Methodology

In this project, I will be utilizing data exploration techniques, data cleaning, and data visualization to analyze the "Shark Attacks" dataset and test the hypotheses mentioned. I will be using Python as the main programming language and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

    - Data Exploration: In this section, I will perform an initial exploration of the "Shark Attacks" dataset, including data loading, data cleaning, and data profiling to gain a better understanding of the data.

    - Data Visualization: In this section, I will create various visualizations to visualize the data and gain insights into the different hypotheses. I will use different types of plots such as bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps to effectively convey the findings.

    - Conclusion: Finally, I will summarize the findings of the project and provide conclusions based on the results obtained from the data analysis.

## Conclusion

Thank you for joining me on this journey of exploring the "Shark Attacks" dataset and testing various hypotheses. I hope you find the insights gained from this analysis informative and interesting. Please refer to the individual sections for detailed analysis and findings. Feel free to provide feedback and suggestions for further improvement. Happy exploring!
