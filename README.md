# Welcome to my First Project: Shark Attacks

Welcome to my first project! In this project, I have been working with a Kaggle Dataset called "Shark Attacks," which contains data on reported shark attacks over the past 100 years. The dataset includes information such as the location of the attacks, the activity being performed at the time, victim information (name, gender, age), shark species, and more.

##Project Overview

As a first approach, I have formulated several hypotheses to test by extracting, cleaning, and visualizing data from the dataset. The main hypotheses I will be investigating are:

    1. Men cause more diving accidents than women, and the same could be applied to shark attacks.
    2. Year by year, shark attacks increase, similar to the global population growth.
    3. Weekends have more shark attacks because beaches are crowded.
    4. Countries with higher per capita income have more boat-related shark attacks.

##Dataset

The "Shark Attacks" dataset from Kaggle is a comprehensive collection of reported shark attacks worldwide, spanning a century. It contains a wide range of variables that can be analyzed to gain insights into various factors contributing to shark attacks.

##Methodology

In this project, I will be utilizing data exploration techniques, data cleaning, and data visualization to analyze the "Shark Attacks" dataset and test the hypotheses mentioned above. I will be using Python as the main programming language and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

##Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

    - Data Exploration: In this section, I will perform an initial exploration of the "Shark Attacks" dataset, including data loading, data cleaning, and data profiling to gain a better understanding of the data.

    - Data Visualization: In this section, I will create various visualizations to visualize the data and gain insights into the different hypotheses. I will use different types of plots such as bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps to effectively convey the findings.

    - Hypothesis Testing: In this section, I will statistically test the formulated hypotheses using appropriate statistical techniques to determine their validity and significance.

    - Conclusion: Finally, I will summarize the findings of the project and provide conclusions based on the results obtained from the data analysis.

##Conclusion

Thank you for joining me on this journey of exploring the "Shark Attacks" dataset and testing various hypotheses. I hope you find the insights gained from this analysis informative and interesting. Please refer to the individual sections for detailed analysis and findings. Feel free to provide feedback and suggestions for further improvement. Happy exploring!
